# breaksaver
This is a simple motion detection application that sends notifications by publishing to an AWS IoT MQTT topic and uploads recordings to S3. It has been tested on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 and relies on [Motion for Linux](https://motion-project.github.io/), along with the Python libraries listed in the main script. 

Notifications are done using an AWS Lambda
